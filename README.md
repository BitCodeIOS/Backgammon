Overview The predecessor of Backgammon was among the oldest games of all time, as early as 3000 B.C.
The ancient Romans played a game called "12 Lines" (Ludus duodecim Scriptorum), similar to or similar to modern backgammon, and still prevails in eastern Mediterranean countries.
Rules The Western backgammon game is for two people to play. The chessboard is divided into 4 parts, or 4 large districts. Each section is alternately marked with 6 wedge-shaped strips or small positions, alternating black and white colors. A vertical line called a boundary divides the chessboard into inner and outer areas. One side uses 15 white pieces while the other uses 15 black pieces. The two sides move their pieces from one stronghold to another in the opposite direction, based on the number of points shown on the dice, from their respective inner areas (also known as the area). Two dice display points can be used to move two pieces, or add them up to move a piece.
Double the calculation when the right (dice shows two identical numbers), for example, two 6 points should be calculated at 4 6 points.
Winning and losing decision When a stronghold is occupied by two or more pieces of the same color, the point is "occupied", and the other person cannot enter the child at this time. In a position where only a single piece, this piece is a "exposed piece" will be landed in the position of the enemy pieces of the "attack." If attacked, the "exposed pieces" should be taken out and placed on the boundary, when it is time to moves, the chess must be "put back" before taking other pieces.
The so-called "put back", that is, according to the dice throw the pieces back to the other side of the empty stronghold. When either party sends all 15 pieces to the area, it can move the pieces to a dummy position outside the board boundary, which is called "off" (bearing off), by rolling out the dice. First of all 15 pieces away from the disc winner.
If the loser has at least one piece off the plate, this game is a single win (singles), If the loser is not a piece of the disc, the other side is the victory (Gammon) doubled score; if the loser is still in the winner of the area left pieces, the other is a victory (backgammon), need to score three times times.
